# MY PORTFOLIO 🌺

<h1>📖 About me</h1>

My name is Karolina Ferdek. I graduated logistics and management studies. I studied at the University of Economics in Katowice and at the University of Silesia in Katowice. 🎓

Currently, I work as an IT Recruiter and I gain theoretical knowledge in the field of technology. I recently became interested in software testing. My main goal is to constantly develop my knowledge and technical skills. In this portfolio I would like to introduce myself and share all my experiences gained during my studies and courses. 📈

I am an ambitious, disciplined and goal-driven person. Additionally, I like new challenges. I appreciate working with people.
Thanks to my previous experience, I have highly developed interpersonal skills and empathy, which help me to see more broadly and function well in a team. In addition, I am characterized by openness and the ability to quickly adapt. ☺️

*My experience* 💼

My experience covers various fields, from the assistance of a specialist in a bank, through a customer service specialist in the logistics and clothing industry, to an independent recruiter in a training and technology company. All my works have taught me a lot and allowed me to develop in various areas.
